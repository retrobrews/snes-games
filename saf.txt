Skipp and Friends

The object of the game is to move all three characters to the EXIT in each level. Each player has 2 limited special abilities that you may use to help advance through the level. The in-game status bar displays the name of each ability and how many times it can be used during that level.
For example, Apple’s two abilities are CARDKEY and SCREAM. Using CARDKEY next to a door will cause it to open and detract one CARDKEY point (you need at least one point to open a door). Her SCREAM stuns nearby enemies for a short period of time.
All three players must be alive and to the exit to complete the level. If you get yourself stuck, press START to pause and then SELECT to restart the level.
After you complete each level a 4 letter password is given to you so that you may resume the game using the Password option at the title screen, after your system has been shut off.
